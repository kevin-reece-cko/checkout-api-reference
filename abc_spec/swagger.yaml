    ## Get started

    Checkout.com provides a collection of APIs that enable you to process and manage payments. Our APIs accept and return JSON in the HTTP body, and return standard <a href="https://www.checkout.com/docs/previous/resources/codes/http-response-codes">HTTP response codes</a>.

    You can consume the APIs directly using your favorite HTTP/REST library or make use of one of our <a href="https://www.checkout.com/docs/previous/integrate/sdks" target="_blank">SDKs</a>.

    We have a testing environment called sandbox, which you can <a href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account">sign up for</a> to test API calls without affecting live data.

    ### Base URLs

    Use the following base URLs when making requests to the APIs:

      | Environment   |      Base URL                                        |
      |---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
      | Sandbox       |  https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/                   |
      | Production    |  https://api.checkout.com/                           |

    ### Looking for more guidance?

    Depending on what integration you need, we've provided <a href="https://www.checkout.com/docs/previous/integrate/">guides to get you set up</a>.

    ###Â Not using APIs?

    We've partnered with many popular <a href="https://www.checkout.com/docs/previous/integrate/e-commerce-platforms">e-commerce platforms</a> so you can get up and running quickly, processing online payments with one of our e-commerce plugins.

    # Authentication

    When you sign up for an account, you are given a secret and public API key
    pair. You authenticate with our API by providing the appropriate key in
    the request Authorization header.

    Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
