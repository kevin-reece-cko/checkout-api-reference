  description: |
    Add a reusable payment source, like a <a href="https://www.checkout.com/docs/previous/payments/payment-methods/direct-debit/sepa-direct-debit" target="blank">SEPA Direct Debit</a>, that you can later use to make one or more payments.
    Payment sources are linked to a specific customer and cannot be shared between customers.
