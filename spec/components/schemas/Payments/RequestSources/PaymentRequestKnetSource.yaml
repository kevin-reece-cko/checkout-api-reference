        description: >-
          This token allows re-use of card details for multiple payments.
          This 8-digit token should be generated by a merchant. When a subsequent payment
          is initialized with the same card token, a customer is presented with two options.
          The customer can choose to pay with KFast (doesn't need to enter card details again),
          or with KNet as usual. The payment flow stays the same i.e. a merchant should redirect
          a customer to the redirect URL which is provided in the payment creation response.
          Note that `user_defined_field3` must be omitted when the `card_token` field is not empty. This restriction
          exists because a card token is passed to KNet Gateway as user defined field 3

          This is an ID for merchant PTLF functionality tracking.

          Note that `user_defined_field5` must be omitted when the `ptlf` field is not empty. This restriction
          exists because a PTLF value is passed to KNet Gateway as user defined field 5
