  Your client credentials consist of an access key ID and an access key secret (corresponding to OAuth 2.0 client ID and client secret). You can exchange these for an access token by calling the [request an access token](#tag/Access/paths/~1connect~1token/post) endpoint. 
  You will need to authenticate using basic authentication, using your access key ID and access key secret as your username and password:

  ```
  curl --location --request POST 'https://access.checkout.com/connect/token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic dGVzdC1hY2Nlc3Mta2V5LWlkOnRlc3QtYWNjZXNzLWtleS1zZWNyZXQ=' \
  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
  --data-urlencode 'scope=gateway'
  ```

  The token server will return a Bearer `access_token` in JSON Web Token (JWT) format which you should use in the `Authorization`
  header of your API requests:

  ```
  curl --location --request POST 'https://api.checkout.com/payments' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {{AccessToken}}' \
  --data-raw '{
    "amount": 10000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "reference": "Visa-USD-Test",
    ...
  }'
  ```

  Your access token will be valid for a length of time (in seconds) indicated by the `expires_in` field in the response. When it expires, you'll need to request a new one.

  Depending on the Environment against which you're making your requests against you'll need to request the token from a different Authorization Server.
