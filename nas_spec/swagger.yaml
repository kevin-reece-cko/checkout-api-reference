    ##  Get started

    Checkout.com provides a collection of APIs that enable you to process and manage payments. Our APIs accept and return JSON in the HTTP body, and return standard <a href="https://www.checkout.com/docs/resources/codes/http-response-codes">HTTP response codes</a>.

    You can consume the APIs directly using your favorite HTTP/REST library.

    We have a testing environment called sandbox, which you can <a href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account">sign up for</a> to test API calls without affecting live data.

    # Authentication

    When you sign up for an account, you can authenticate with either Access keys (OAuth 2.0), or Secret API keys.

    Unless explicitly stated, all endpoints require authentication using either your Access or Secret API Keys. Public keys should only be used in JavaScript or native applications.

    - <b>Client-side authentication</b>. Use your [public key](#section/Authentication/ApiPublicKey) for client-side authentication. It only has access to a limited set of our APIs â€“ mostly those called as part of your payment environment.

    - <b>Server-to-server authentication</b>. Use your [secret key](#section/Authentication/ApiSecretKey) or [OAuth](#section/Authentication/OAuth) for server-to-server communication. Support for API keys depends on the endpoint.

    Never share your OAuth credentials, API keys, or access tokens. Keep them guarded and secure.
