    <a href="https://www.checkout.com/docs/four/payments/store-payment-details/customers" target="_blank">Store a customer's details in a customer object to reuse in future payments</a>. When creating a customer, you can link payment instruments – the customer `id` returned can be passed as a source when making a payment.
    <br/><br>
    **NOTE:** Specify a `default` instrument, otherwise the `instruments` array will not be saved on creation.
