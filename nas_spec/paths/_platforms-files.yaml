    Our Platforms solution provides an easy way to upload documentation required for full due diligence.
    
    Use this endpoint to generate a file upload link, which you can then upload a file to using a data-binary type request.
    
    Please note that the sub-domain – https://files.checkout.com – is slightly different to Checkout.com's other endpoints. See the <a href="https://checkout.com/docs/platforms/onboarding/api/full/upload-a-file" target="_blank">documentation</a> for more information.
