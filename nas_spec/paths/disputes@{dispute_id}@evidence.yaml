  summary: Provide dispute evidence
  operationId: provideDisputeEvidence
  description: >
    Adds supporting evidence to a dispute. Before using this endpoint, you first
    need to [upload your files](#tag/Disputes/paths/~1files/post) using the file
    uploader. You will receive a file id (prefixed by `file_`) which you can
    then use in your request.
    Note that this only attaches the evidence to the dispute, it does not send
    it to us. Once ready, you will need to submit it.
    **You must provide at least one evidence type in the body of your request.**
