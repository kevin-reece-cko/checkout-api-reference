    # Introduction

    The Checkout.com API is built on HTTP. Our API is RESTful. It has predictable
    resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
    accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.


    You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Checkout's API,
    or you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in
    [PHP](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-php-library),
    [.NET](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-net-library) and
    [Java](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-java-library)).

    # Authentication

    When you sign up for an account, you are given a secret and public API key
    pair. You authenticate with the Checkout.com API by providing the appropriate key in
    the request Authorization header.


    Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.

      Webhooks are designed to notify your systems when certain/all registered
      events happen in near real-time.

      They allow you to collect information about those events. Checkout.com can send
      these information via POST to an URL of your choice.

      summary: Request a payment
      description: |
        Checkout.com supports payments from a variety of sources, from card payments to
        SEPA direct debits. The source of payment can be specified using the `source.type` field along with any source specific data.
    
        To verify the success of the payment, check the `approved` field in the response.
    
        ### Reference Tokens
    
        The most common way of making card payments is using a token generated by [Checkout Frames](#).
        This is mandatory for non-PCI compliant merchants as it ensures no card details are transferred to your server.
        This integration method also applies to digital wallets such as Apple Pay and Google Pay.
    
        Note: Reference tokens expire after 15 minutes.
    
        ```json
        {
          "source": {
            "type": "token",
            "token": "tok_ubfj2q76miwundwlk72vxt2i7q",
            "billing_address": { ... },
            "phone": { ... }
          },
          "amount": 5600,
          "currency": "GBP"
        }
        ```
    
        #### Full Card Details
    
        To make a card payment specify the source type card.
    
        Note that full card payments should only be requested by PCI compliant merchants.
    
        ```json
        {
          "source": {
            "type": "card",
            "number": "4242424242424242",
            "expiry_month": 6,
            "expiry_year": 2018
          },
          "amount": 5600,
          "currency": "GBP"
        }
        ```
    
        ### Existing Source
    
        When a card payment is processed you will be returned a source identifier that can later be used to make payments.
        You can also add payment sources for Alternative Payments via the [Sources API](#tag/Sources).
    
        ```json
        {
          "source": {
            "type": "id",
            "id": "src_wmlfc3zyhqzehihu7giusaaawu",
            "cvv" "843"
          },
          "amount": 5600,
          "currency": "GBP",
          "customer": {
            "id": "cus_yhn5qqcar3velcwqq47dmxjy4m"
          }
        }
        ```
    
        ### Customer
    
        You can provide the ID or email of an existing customer to make a payment using their default payment method.
    
        ```json
        {
          "source": {
            "type": "customer",
            "id": "cus_y3oqhf46pyzuxjbcn2giaqnb44",
          },
          "amount": 5600,
          "currency": "GBP"
        }
        ```
    
        ### Alternative Payments
    
        Checkout.com supports a number of alternative payment methods. Reusable payment sources such as SEPA Direct Debits must first be created via the [Sources API](#tag/Sources).
    
        For non-reusable payment methods such as those that use a redirect flow (e.g. iDEAL), provide the name of the payment method as the source.type along with any payment method specific data.
    
        ```json
        {
          "source": {
            "type": "ideal",
            "issuer_id": "TESTISSUER01"
          },
          "amount": 5600,
          "currency": "GBP"
        }
        ```
